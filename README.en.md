# auto_py2to3

#### Description

On January 1, 2020, the Python 2 code base was frozen. Since that day, there has been no further backport of Python 2, which actually makes this language and runtime environment obsolete. Nick Coghlan, the core developer, explained in the FAQ, thus ending the situation of “the core development team maintains Python 2 and 3 at the same time as a reference interpreter for about 13 years”. The final version of Python 2 is currently passing the beta testing and release candidate stage, and the last production-level version of Python 2.7.18 is expected to be launched in April 2020. Although most people in the Python community agree that Python needs drastic changes—especially because of the much-needed Unicode support that was already there. But many people are frustrated that Python 2 code works well. Therefore, code migration is required, and the ultimate purpose of the library is to enable automated and rapid code migration and provide automated testing. In this process, although there may be some unsatisfactory places in the code migration process, the library will continue to iterate and maintain.
